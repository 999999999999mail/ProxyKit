# Proxy Kit [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/damianh/ProxyKit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/damianh/ProxyKit)

An AspNet Core Proxy middleware, use for application to proxy requests or to create small focused (containerized) proxies.

Forked from [AspNet labs](https://github.com/aspnet/AspLabs/tree/master/src/Proxy) but with a different API to facilitate a wider variety of proxying scenarios i.e. routing based on JWT claim.
